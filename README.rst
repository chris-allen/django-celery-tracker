=========================
Celery Tracker for Django
=========================

|build-status| |coverage|

This django extension is intended for existing celery projects that want better monitoring of what's going on in their queue.

Usage
=====

To use this with your project, you need to:

1. Install django-celery-tracker:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install django-celery-tracker

2. Add ``django_celery_tracker`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your Django settings file:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django_celery_tracker',
    )

3. Create the database tables by applying migrations:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python manage.py migrate django_celery_tracker

4. You will now have a record of all *future* celery tasks and their progress which can queried like so:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python manage.py console
    ...
    >>> from django_celery_tracker.models import CeleryTask
    >>> CeleryTask.objects.all()
    <QuerySet [<CeleryTask: id=3d889396-daa2-4209-9348-9ec71bfb1262, name=api.taskapp.celery.debug_task>]

Disclaimer
==========

The datastore for a celery message queue is usually in-memory and highly-optimized (eg ``redis`` or ``rabbitmq``).  This django extension creates a database entry for every celery task that is created. You may want to periodically delete older entries if storage is an obstacle.
